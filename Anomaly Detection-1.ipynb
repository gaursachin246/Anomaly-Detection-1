    "\n",
    "#1. Identify unusual patterns: Detect rare or unusual events, such as fraudulent transactions or network intrusions.\n",
    "#2. Prevent losses: Identify potential risks or threats, allowing for proactive measures to prevent losses or damage.\n",
    "#3. Improve efficiency: Detect anomalies in processes or systems, enabling optimization and improvement.\n",
    "#4. Enhance security: Identify potential security threats, such as malware or unauthorized access.\n",
    "#5. Support decision-making: Provide insights into unusual trends or patterns, informing business decisions.\n"

    "#1. Defining normal behavior: Establishing a baseline for normal behavior can be difficult, especially in complex systems.\n",
    "#2. High false positive rates: Anomaly detection models can generate many false alarms, leading to unnecessary investigations.\n",
    "#3. Low true positive rates: Failing to detect actual anomalies can lead to missed opportunities or undetected threats.\n",
    "#4. Data quality issues: Noisy, incomplete, or biased data can negatively impact anomaly detection accuracy.\n",
    "#5. Scalability: Anomaly detection must handle large datasets and high-speed data streams.\n",
    "#6. Real-time detection: Detecting anomalies in real-time is crucial for timely action.\n",
    "#7. Interpretability: Understanding why an anomaly was detected is essential for effective decision-making.\n",
    "#8. Evolving patterns: Anomaly detection must adapt to changing patterns and behaviors over time.\n",
    "#. Class imbalance: Anomalies are often rare, making it challenging to train effective models.\n",
    "#10. Explainability: Providing insights into detected anomalies is critical for trust and actionability.\n",
